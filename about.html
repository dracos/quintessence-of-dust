&ldquo;I have always been interested in the hustle and bustle of the
theatre, such as everything that goes on literally behind the scenes in
the weeks and months before in order to make the work of art that I see
as a member of the audience on a particular night. It's one of the
reasons I set up <a href="http://theatricalia.com/">Theatricalia</a>, to
record details of as many productions as possible, letting people see
the history of people, places, and productions as they each move
through the theatre world.

<p>&ldquo;With the advent of the World Shakespeare Festival, I thought it would be
interesting to be able to see an overview of the productions involved in the
Festival across the country. As I'm a web developer by profession, I naturally
wanted this to be a website-based data visualisation &ndash; one that as well as an
animation showing the overview, allowed people to interact with it and find out
more information about the events covered.

<p>&ldquo;From the Shipwreck Trilogy in Stratford-upon-Avon and London at the
Roundhouse, Forests at the Birmingham Rep, or Y Storm (The Tempest) at the
National Eisteddfod of Wales, my work provides a summary of the Festival
productions and associated events.

&ldquo;The World Shakespeare Festival toured throughout the UK during
the summer of 2012 and we wanted to find a way of looking at that journey
&ndash; creating something exciting and dynamic from our spreadsheet of
numbers.     

<p>&ldquo;The starting point for the commission was our performance data, lists
of numbers, dates, times, locations, venues, performances and repertoire. What
we needed to find from the individual figures was a sense of the whole, a way
of representing the involvement of the cities and towns from Edinburgh to
Brighton and everything in between.

<p>&ldquo;We were also keen to open up the data and share with those who had
been involved in certain productions or locations a way of seeing how their
experience was related to the wider festival. In this commission you can see
how productions moved around, for example from Stratford to London and back
again, and also the spread of locations and environments the productions
performed in. The timeline charts the festival, as more blobs appear the busier
we get and it's a real reminder of the task we undertook this year.

<p>&ldquo;Matthew has really brought to life our data, it's amazing to see all
the clocks whirling over the map, popping up in so many places.&rdquo;
