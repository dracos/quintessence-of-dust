&ldquo;I have always been interested in the hustle and bustle of the
theatre, such as everything that goes on literally behind the scenes in
the weeks and months before in order to make the work of art that I see
as a member of the audience on a particular night. It's one of the
reasons I set up <a href="http://theatricalia.com/">Theatricalia</a>, to
record details of as many productions as possible, letting people see
the history of people, places, and productions as they each move
through the theatre world.

<p>&ldquo;With the advent of the World Shakespeare Festival, I thought it would be
interesting to be able to see an overview of the productions involved in the
Festival across the country. As I'm a web developer by profession, I naturally
wanted this to be a website-based data visualisation &ndash; one that as well as an
animation showing the overview, allowed people to interact with it and find out
more information about the events covered.

<p>&ldquo;From the What Country Friends Is This? Trilogy in Stratford-upon-Avon and London at the
Roundhouse, Forests at the Birmingham Rep, or Y Storm (The Tempest) at the
National Eisteddfod of Wales, my work provides a summary of the Festival
productions and associated events.

&ldquo;The World Shakespeare Festival reached over 1.8 million people since it opened
on Shakespeareâ€™s birthday, 23rd April 2012. Over a period of 8 months,
productions and events took place across the UK and we wanted to find a way of
representing that journey through an exciting presentation using our
performance data and statistics.   
 
<p>&ldquo;The starting point for this commission was a large spreadsheet containing lists
of numbers, dates, times, locations, venues, performances and repertoire. This
data enabled us to portray the geographical journey of the Festival, from April
to November, by representing the involvement of all the various cities and
towns, from Edinburgh to Brighton, and everywhere in between. On the map you
can see how productions moved and toured around (for example from Stratford to
London and back again), you can also get a sense of the spread of locations and
environments where the productions performed within the period. As more clocks
appear, you can see how the Festival evolved over time.
 
<p>&ldquo;The spread of colour on the clocks highlights the sheer breath of the Festival
with its international commissions and collaborations, RSC productions and
co-productions, UK partner productions, professional-amateur collaborations,
work for young people, exhibitions and events.  There was also a significant
online and digital element to the Festival, including MyShakespeare, together
with TV broadcasts, live web streaming, blogging and social media activity that
engaged viewers and participants from across the world, however as these were
virtual media, they are not shown on our map.
 
<p>&ldquo;Matthew has really brought our data to life.&rdquo;</p>
